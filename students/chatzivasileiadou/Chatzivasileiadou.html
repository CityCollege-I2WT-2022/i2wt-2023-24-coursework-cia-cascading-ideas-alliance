                        My name is Irida Chatzivasileiadou. I was born July 1st 2003. Even before I fell in love with gaming, I was extremely interested in computers, after being encourage exploring them from a young age, and decided to pursue a Computer Science education. <br><br>
                        My first attempt at doing so was at the Department of Information and Electronic Engineering in IHU, but, due to a variety of reasons, including the grueling commute back and forth, I decided that it wasn't a match. Cue a relentless search for my next step. After looking through a variety of choices, others centered on Computer Science and others on more artistic subjects, I ended up choosing Computer Science in City College, where I reside to this day.

                            The day that photo was taken I was doing a photoshoot at Kastra in Agio Paulo and gave a group of tourists quite the unique shight-seeing experience.

                        As previously stated I have a deep love for gaming, I especially have a soft spot for indie puzzle games with complex puzzles and lore, but in general I enjoy most types of games. Even though indie games have a special place in my heart, the game series I've dedicated most of my time to, on and off game, is the Dark Souls series. I've played all the titles at least once, and, usually I act as a coach and lore encyclopedia for friends that want to try it.<br><br>
                        Gaming also, had a big part in me discovering and getting involved with another one of my hobbies, which is cosplay. Here's where the more artistic side of me comes into play, because I love creating the costumes and the props for my cosplays by myself. Cosplay is a hobby that gives you the chance to explore a plethora of other hobbies and crafts in the process, while being able to learn how to be extremely creative and resourceful. Because of cosplay I've learned how to sew, create props out of foam board and EVA foam (such as the mask depicted in the picture) , bodypaint and much more. My ultimate goal is to learn how to make realistic armors and cosplay Artorias the Abysswalker from Dark Souls.<br><br>
                        Before high school, I also used to read a lot, but sadly the Greek education system snuffed that right out of me. But it's a hobby I try to get back into, both because I find it extremely relaxing and a great means of escapism, but also because it helps me to work on my writing skills, seeing as I enjoy writing as well. </p>

                        I approached this project with my love for gaming and a lot of big ideas. Ideas that were probably a bit too big for what we thought we could accomplish in the timeframe we had. So we opted to do something a bit less ambitious but equally as fun and interesting. The fact that our site idea was so compelling was a big factor that made us want to work even harder, so it would come into fruition. I think our team was very lucky, because it consisted of people with very similar work ethics and ways of thinking that complemented each other.<br><br>
                        We worked extremely close, arranging frequent meetings so we could create our website more efficiently and the work could be distributed equally, so a lot of the general templates are a group effort. My personal contributions, other than the work that was done along with my colleagues were:
