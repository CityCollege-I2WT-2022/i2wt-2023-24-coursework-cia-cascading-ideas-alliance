                        New Year's 2024. In the middle of a few deadlines (including the one of the present work), still finding a few moments to enjoy life, with a drinky.

                    A few words about me

                <p class="textBlock">
                    My name is Dimitris (as mentioned at the top of the page as well in some paperwork). I was born August 23, 1993, early enough to grow up with dial-up internet, floppy disks and those phones with an antenna and the little keyboard cover. 
                    <br><br>
                    Although I always tinkered with computers, back in school I was good with stuff like History, Greek, Latin etc. so I ended up in Law School. To my surprise however, no law courses were in Latin and so I was gradually disenchanted by the subject.
                    <br><br>
                    Fast forward a couple years and I find myself employed at a company that supports a well-known cloud service (which I'm not allowed to formally disclose due to an NDA - nothing to do with NBA, the two are apparently different), when I catch myself thinking that I would like to work with computer systems in one way or another but not in customer support (extremely boring stuff).
                    <br><br>
                    Long story short, here I am, enrolling on the Friday just before the Induction week, embarking on this 3-year long journey. One of my better decisions I should say!<br>

                        Not technically a hobby, but cannot be ommitted: my dogs. Rika is the brown one and Bobby the black and white. They're cute but they're a menace, especially Bobby. In this picture, Rika is apparently worried at Bobby's approach as this could mean less petting for her. Bobby is very smart and inquisitive and knows his approaching technique will earn him a pat.

                    Hobbies. I really wish I had the time. Let's start with being an avid Formula 1 fan, so whenever my girfriend does not decide otherwise (I'll be removing this bit for the version I show her), I watch races on weekends. I also watch my footbal team, Aris, however football is definitely not my greatest passion.<br><br> I also used to play videogames a lot back in the day, however these days it's hard to find enough time to enjoy them. In my life, I have been both a console and a PC person, and my favourite games of all time is the Mass Effect trilogy, which I have completed 3 times. I have also played CounterStrike for more hours than I'd like to admit.<br><br> I have enjoyed quite a few activities as hobbies in the past, however one that I have enjoyed all my life is reading books. I do enjoy many genres and I'm especially partial to science fiction and fantasy. It's hard to decide on a favourite series, but if I had to recommend a favorite science fiction novel series, that would always be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series">"The culture" series by Iain M. Banks.</a>

                        In this picture, I'm in a bouldering gym in London, recovering from Covid, and I needed to take a profile picture in order to register at the gym. When I came back from London I enrolled at CITY College, so this truly spontaneous selfie, readily available on my phone, incidentally became my profile pic for everything.

                    The words about our team in the About section were originally chosen for this personal website, however, as they speak for all of us, they were moved there and I am free to fill this remaining space with my final thoughts and information regarding my personal contribution to the project. <br><br>As team leader, I found myself in a position that I'm sure others would find challenging. I have to say that my case turned out in fact to be the opposite, not so much because of any skill on my part, but because I was lucky to team up with two amazing developers, who shared the work ethic, enthusiasm, attention to detail, creativity and sense of humour that came to shape our website.<br><br>We worked so much together, that outside of the parts that each one of us coded separately, it is hard to know where one contibution ends and the next starts. <br><br>As per the requirements, under my personal purview was the homepage, simple as that may be, while other personal contributions have been the final version of the navigation bar, the comment utility as well as a couple randomizer utilities for recommendations.<br><br>Finally, other contributions have been the organisation of team meetings, especially in the early days of this effort, as well as keeping minutes and creating the communication and filesharing channels that were utilized during the creation of HaHaHeaven.
